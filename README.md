# Minimum Cut Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of algorithms designed to find the minimum cut in a graph. A **minimum cut** is the smallest set of edges that, if removed, would disconnect the graph.

## Algorithms Overview

### Karger-Stein Algorithm

The Karger-Stein algorithm is a randomized method that recursively contracts edges in a graph to approximate the minimum cut. While it doesn't always guarantee finding the exact minimum cut, repeating the algorithm increases the probability of success.

### Stoer-Wagner Algorithm

The Stoer-Wagner algorithm is a deterministic approach that systematically merges vertices to identify the minimum cut in an undirected graph. It guarantees finding the exact minimum cut in polynomial time.
